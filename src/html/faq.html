          1. Open task manager then go to the details tab<br />
          2. Find LeagueClient.exe then right click and click properties<br />
          3. Copy the location then go to config/clientPath.txt in the profile
          tool<br />
          4. Paste it there, save, and restart the tool.

        <dt>Will there be more updates?</dt>
        <dd>
          Most likely not. The developer who made this tool will be going back
          to university and will not be working on this tool anymore. I
          (Paradax) have been given permission to maintain the repo and might
          release new updates in the future.
        </dd>
        <dt>Where do I see updates/changes?</dt>
        <dd>
          They will be posted in the discord server and the releases section of
          github
        </dd>
        <dt>I want to develop another version of this tool</dt>
        <dd>
          Go for it! If you have any questions feel free to ask in the discord
          server, or send either of us a DM.
